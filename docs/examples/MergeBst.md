## Code Description

The code defines a function `merge_bsts` that merges two Binary Search Trees (BSTs) into a single sorted list. It uses an inorder traversal to extract sorted lists from each BST and then merges these sorted lists using a min-heap.

## Approach Summary

The approach involves three key steps: First, perform an inorder traversal on both BSTs to obtain two sorted lists. Second, merge these sorted lists using a min-heap data structure. Finally, return the merged and sorted list.

## Detailed Approach

1.  **Inorder Traversal:** Traverse the first BST (`root1`) using an inorder traversal and store the node values in `list1`. Inorder traversal ensures that the values are stored in ascending order since it's a BST.
2.  **Inorder Traversal:** Similarly, traverse the second BST (`root2`) using inorder traversal and store the node values in `list2`.
3.  **Merge with Heap:** Use the `merge_sorted_lists_heap` function to merge `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted list. This function uses a min-heap to efficiently merge the lists. Elements from both lists are added to the heap, and the smallest element is repeatedly extracted to form the merged list.
4.  **Return Merged List:** Return the `merged_list` which contains all the elements from both BSTs in sorted order.

## Time Complexity

Let n be the number of nodes in the first BST and m be the number of nodes in the second BST.

*   Inorder traversal of the first BST takes O(n) time.
*   Inorder traversal of the second BST takes O(m) time.
*   Merging the two sorted lists using a heap takes O((n+m)log(n+m)) time, since each insertion and deletion from the heap takes O(log(n+m)) time, and we perform n+m such operations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(m) + O((n+m)log(n+m)) which simplifies to O((n+m)log(n+m)).

## Space Complexity

Let n be the number of nodes in the first BST and m be the number of nodes in the second BST.

*   `list1` stores n elements, so it takes O(n) space.
*   `list2` stores m elements, so it takes O(m) space.
*   The heap stores at most n+m elements, so it takes O(n+m) space.
*   The `merged_list` stores n+m elements, so it takes O(n+m) space.

Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(n) + O(m) + O(n+m) + O(n+m) which simplifies to O(n+m).

## Code Walkthrough

*   `inorder_traversal(root, lst)`: This function performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree. If the current node `root` is not None, it recursively traverses the left subtree, appends the value of the current node to the list `lst`, and then recursively traverses the right subtree.
*   `merge_sorted_lists_heap(list1, list2)`: This function merges two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` into a single sorted list using a min-heap. It initializes an empty list `merged_list` and an empty heap. It iterates through both lists, pushing elements into the heap. Once all elements are in the heap, it repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap and appends it to `merged_list`.
*   `merge_bsts(root1, root2)`: This function merges two BSTs represented by `root1` and `root2`. It initializes two empty lists, `list1` and `list2`. It performs inorder traversal on both BSTs, storing the node values in the respective lists. It then calls `merge_sorted_lists_heap` to merge the two sorted lists into a single sorted list, which it returns.

## Edge Cases

*   **Empty Trees:** If either or both of the input BSTs are empty, the code handles this gracefully. If both are empty, it returns an empty list. If one is empty, it effectively returns the inorder traversal of the other tree.
*   **Duplicate Values:** The code correctly handles duplicate values in the BSTs. The `merge_sorted_lists_heap` function ensures that duplicates are preserved in the merged list.
*   **Large Trees:** For very large trees, the space complexity O(n+m) could become a concern, but the code will still function correctly given sufficient memory.

## Key Concepts

*   **Binary Search Tree (BST):** A binary tree where for each node, all nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all nodes in its right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
*   **Inorder Traversal:** A tree traversal algorithm that visits the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree. For a BST, inorder traversal yields the nodes in sorted order.
*   **Min-Heap:** A tree-based data structure where the value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children. It allows efficient retrieval of the smallest element.
*   **Heapq Module:** Python's built-in module for implementing a heap data structure. `heapq.heappush` adds an element to the heap, and `heapq.heappop` removes and returns the smallest element from the heap.

## Example Input

Let's consider two BSTs:

BST1:

```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```

BST2:

```
    8
   / \
  5   9
```

In this case, the `root1` would be the node with value 2, and `root2` would be the node with value 8. These are good example inputs because they represent two simple, yet distinct, BSTs that need to be merged and contain different value ranges.

## Step-by-Step Trace

1.  `merge_bsts(root1, root2)` is called.
2.  `list1` and `list2` are initialized as empty lists: `list1 = []`, `list2 = []`.
3.  `inorder_traversal(root1, list1)` is called:
    *   Visits node 1, appends 1 to `list1`: `list1 = [1]`
    *   Visits node 2, appends 2 to `list1`: `list1 = [1, 2]`
    *   Visits node 3, appends 3 to `list1`: `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`
4.  `inorder_traversal(root2, list2)` is called:
    *   Visits node 5, appends 5 to `list2`: `list2 = [5]`
    *   Visits node 8, appends 8 to `list2`: `list2 = [5, 8]`
    *   Visits node 9, appends 9 to `list2`: `list2 = [5, 8, 9]`
5.  `merge_sorted_lists_heap(list1, list2)` is called with `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [5, 8, 9]`.
6.  The `merge_sorted_lists_heap` function uses `heapq.heappush` to push elements to the heap. The heap will contain elements from both lists. `heap` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]` during insertions (not necessarily in this order due to the nature of heap implementation, but the min-heap property is maintained).
7.  The `merge_sorted_lists_heap` function uses `heapq.heappop` to pop the smallest element from the heap, and adds to `merged_list` repeatedly. The `merged_list` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`.
8.  `merge_bsts` returns `merged_list` which is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`.

## Visual Representation

BST1:

```
    2
   / \
  1   3
```

BST2:

```
    8
   / \
  5   9
```

Inorder(BST1) -> \[1, 2, 3]

Inorder(BST2) -> \[5, 8, 9]

Merged List -> \[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]

## Intermediate Outputs

*   After inorder traversal of BST1: `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`
*   After inorder traversal of BST2: `list2 = [5, 8, 9]`
*   Intermediate state of heap (during the merging process): `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]` (elements are added to the heap, maintaining heap property). Note that this is an illustrative representation; the actual heap structure is more complex.

## Final Result

The final merged and sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]`. This correctly merges the values from both BSTs into a single sorted list.
